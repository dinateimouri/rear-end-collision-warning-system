### A-real-time-warning-system-for-rear-end-collision
Rear-end collision warning system has a great role for increasing the driving safety. In this system, some measures are used to estimate the danger and system warns drivers to be more cautious. To enhance the effect of system, the real-time processes should be executed to remain enough time and distance to avoid collision with the front car. To this end, in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10988.pdf) a new system is developed based on vehicles trajectory data of 100 car's database from Virginia tech transportation institute. This repository contains the required code.
